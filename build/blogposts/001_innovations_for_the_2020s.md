If the 2010s are to be characterized as a period of stagnation in innovation and progess, then why, you might ask, would the 2020s be any different? In the domains I pay attention to, it is my firm belief and resolve that we're only just scratching the surface of what's possible. Elon & friends have shown it's possible to break through the schleorsis. The 2020s will be different because my generation is up to bat, and these are problems I'm determined to work on and progress the frontier on. 

Below is my list of what I believe will be areas we will see progress and innovation within the next decade. The following predictions are made solely within my area of interest / expertise. 

1. Alternatives to HTML + CSS + JS
The current web stack as it stands today is not an optimal substrate for the webapps being built today. For building the really complex apps, we use a whole slew of frameworks and libraries to optimize time to load, to to paint, javascript bundle sizes, etc, all to compile down to HTML: a markup language built for static documents. We also have to fight limitations of user browsers, limitations of Javascript, of HTML. The Chrome and Firefox teams and friends have been making efforts to improve the situation by adding more features such as Portals, Web Components, Amp -- the spec for implementing a browser has gotten so complicated that only the likes of Google will be able to have fully implemented it correctly.

Between the age of the document centric model and the stranglehold / monopoly Google is gaining on the browser market, I predict that we'll begin seeing frameworks that target a layer lower than document markup via wasm. Companies such as Figma which have already bumped into limitations in the document view model are already using wasm + gl to power their visual editor. At the time of writing this article, wasm currently stands at 91% supported by browser marketshare. As this score goes up, I believe it's plausible we'll begin to see webapp frameworks and entire toolchains that target wasm rather than the html model.

2. New server <-> client transport models
GraphQL and gRPC and their associated toolchains are massive milestones for transport models, and there's still so much more to come. Besides solving for the problem of sending exactly data necessary as quickly and cheaply as possible, the 2020s also will introduce technologies such as VR which require a whole set of new constraints -- a bigger focus on data streaming, more data than ever before, etc. Most of the following are incremental innovations, but could have big implications if acted on:
  * Technologies to generate UIs based off of an API shape / schema
  * Company data (in its entirety) as a schema -- a schema that would be suitable even for data scientists to query on.

3. SQL
In the 2010s, attempts were made to succeed SQL via the NoSQL movement -- MongoDB, Dynamo, Redis, BigTable, etc. I predict well continue to see attempts to succeed SQL model on the query model level. As data models become more complex, we'll continue to need more imperitive ways to make queries. It's pretty hard to writing complex queries in SQL today and imo much easier to query with collectors / iterators as one would with Mongoose. Graph Queries? GraphQL as a database? Theres a lot of possibilities for what the next evolution in DBs will look like.

Anyway, these are the innovations in areas I'm familiar with that I think we'll see within the next decade. Outside of these spaces, I'm super hyped for the work SpaceX is doing in getting us closer to mars, and in the work FB, Unreal, and Nvidia are doing in graphics and VR. Of all these predictions, I think #1 is most important and is what I'll primarily look to focus on in this decade.

Heres to hoping this next decade's innovation isn't 280 characters
